# Print out strings using type double in C
I made use of the data storage rule of floating point-number(IEEE 754) to print out a specific string which is hard to recognize using only naked eye.

* `ori.c`: a double-precision floating-point number that represents string `jserv++C`
* `account.c`: find a double-precision floating-point number that represents my github account (`afcidk`)
* `name.c`: modify the number in `account.c` using addition and multiplication to transfer my github account (`afcidk`) to my lastname (`Hung`)
